# Elasticsearch DevOps Project: Scalable Search and Analytics Solution

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project demonstrates the setup and configuration of **Elasticsearch** in a scalable and resilient architecture. The example involves handling JSON documents like customer contracts, invoices, and support tickets to showcase indexing, searching, and managing data in real-world scenarios. It highlights key Elasticsearch features and integrates with DevOps practices to ensure automation and reproducibility.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Cluster Setup**: Deploying an Elasticsearch cluster with multiple nodes for fault tolerance and scalability.
- **Index Management**: Configuring mappings, index templates, and shards for optimal performance.
- **Data Streams**: Ingesting real-time, time-based data such as logs or customer interactions.
- **Backup and Restore**: Automating snapshots to a cloud storage solution (e.g., GCP buckets).
- **DevOps Integration**: Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like **Terraform**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes** to provision and manage the Elasticsearch cluster.
